      <description>Original Article: Small Functions considered Harmful
Highlights:
 The best abstraction is an abstraction that optimizes for good enough, not perfect. That’s a feature, not a bug. Understanding this very salient nature of abstractions is the key to designing good ones.
 Abstractions, in my opinion, can’t ever be entirely “right” or “wrong” since the line demarcating “right” from “wrong” is inherently blurred and ever-changing. Our carefully handcrafted artisanal “perfect” abstraction is only one business requirement or bug report away from being consigned to the status of “wrong”.</description>
