      <description>This talk will look at some of the lessons learned from migrating the codebase of the elm-geometry package from its object-oriented origins in C++ and Scala to its current implementation in Elm.
Weâ€™ll show how to take code that depends on various features found in object-oriented languages and rewrite that code in idiomatic Elm. For example, in a language without overloading or implicit conversions, how do you write functions that work with both vectors and unit vectors?</description>
